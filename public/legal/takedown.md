# Policy for Reporting Rights Infringement and Handling Requests for Content Removal

FCMM respects the rights of all users and expects you to respect the rights of others. If content (photos, text, videos, etc.) distributed through our service infringes on the rights of others or contains illegal material, and we receive a report of such content, FCMM will promptly take action according to the procedures outlined in this policy. By using our service, all users are deemed to agree to the following "Policy for Reporting Rights Infringement and Handling Requests for Content Removal."

<br><br>

---

### Compliance

FCMM complies with relevant laws including the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection in Korea. This policy outlines the procedures for receiving and handling reports of content that infringes the rights of others as an internet service provider.

<br><br>

### Reporting Requirements

Individuals or organizations ("reporters") reporting rights infringement must ensure that their report is accurate and complete. If the report is unclear, processing may be delayed or impossible. Reports should include at least the following information:

1. Reporter Information: Name, affiliation (if an organization), contact number, email address  
2. Infringing Content Information: Exact URL of the FCMM sportswear content in question  
3. Rights Infringement Details: A specific description of what rights (copyright, portrait rights, defamation, etc.) were infringed and supporting evidence  
4. Reason for Report: A detailed explanation of why the content is illegal or violates FCMM's Terms of Service or Privacy Policy

<br><br>

### Disclaimer

The reporter agrees to exempt FCMM from any disputes with content creators and from all legal issues arising from the actions taken by FCMM (content removal, temporary suspension, etc.) related to this report.

<br><br>

### Urgent Processing Request

The reporter may request urgent handling by explaining the urgency of the matter. In this case, all reasons requiring urgent action must be clearly stated. FCMM will determine whether urgent action is necessary at its discretion based on the submitted information.

<br><br>

### Evaluation of Reports

FCMM evaluates submitted reports and classifies them into one of the following three types:

- Requests from Public Institutions: Official legal requests from administrative or judicial authorities such as the Korea Communications Commission or law enforcement agencies  
- Clear Rights Infringement: Content that is judged to clearly infringe third-party rights such as copyright, portrait rights, or reputation  
- Others: Content that does not fall into the above categories and for which it is difficult to determine rights infringement or where disputes exist between parties

<br><br>

### Action Taken

Actions depend on the classification of the report:

- **Clear Rights Infringement (category 1 or 2)**: If FCMM determines that the content clearly violates the law or infringes on the rights of others, it will immediately **delete or temporarily restrict access (blind removal)** to the content.  
- **Unclear Rights Infringement (category 3)**:  
  • If FCMM cannot independently determine whether rights are infringed, it may notify the reporter without deleting the content.  
  • Alternatively, FCMM may notify the content creator ("creator") of the report and request that they (a) voluntarily delete or modify the content or (b) resolve the issue directly with the reporter.  
  • If no agreement is reached between the creator and the reporter, or the creator does not comply with FCMM's request, FCMM may temporarily restrict access to the content for 30 days in accordance with applicable laws and terms of service. This restriction may be lifted if no court judgment or formal agreement between the parties is reached.

<br><br>

### Processing Time

Reports will be evaluated and appropriate action will generally be completed promptly, within a maximum of 10 days.

<br><br>

### Minimum Necessary Action

When deleting content or restricting access, FCMM will take action **only to the extent necessary** and directly related to the reported issue.
